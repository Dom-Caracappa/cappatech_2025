# CappaTech Project Utilities

## Overview

## Features
- **Dependency Fixer**: Automatically resolves missing and conflicting dependencies in your PNPM workspace.
- **Project Metadata Generator**: Generates a `project.json` file that documents the project's structure, dependencies, and environment.
- **Custom CLI**: Provides a single entry point for running scripts with a fun and interactive interface.

Creates a `project.json` file with structured details of the project.
```sh
pnpm generate-project
```
- Captures workspace dependencies.
- Lists installed packages per workspace.
- Tracks API URLs and environment variables.

### **Run CLI**
